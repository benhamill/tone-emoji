# Contributing

Help is gladly welcomed. If you have a change you'd like to suggest, it's much
more likely to get in (or get in faster) the closer you stick to these steps:

1. Open an Issue to talk about it. We can discuss whether it's the right
   direction or maybe help workshop an idea, etc.
1. Fork the project, and make a branch to work on your idea. You'll want to
   start from `main`.
1. Bonus points for good commit messages and not creating a ton of merge commit
   noise by using `git rebase` well.

When in doubt, make an Issue to discuss.
